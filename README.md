# Typed Show

A simple, locally hosted, web-based, text-based slide show application with the convenience of markdown.

## Getting started

To get the app running...you'll need the following:

* [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [bower](http://bower.io/)

Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/deostroll/typed-show.git
```

Install the npm/bower dependencies followed by running the default grunt task:

```
cd typed-show && npm i && bower install
```
Once done, type the following:

```
grunt
```
This starts a local-hosted web server. Browse to `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to access the application.

Just add a slide and type in `**Hello World**` in the huge text box, and click on **Run** to start slide show.

To exit slide show hit <kbd>ESC</kbd>
